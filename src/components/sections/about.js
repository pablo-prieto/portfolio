      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Ever since the age of 12 I have enjoyed tinkering with technology - from
        building and sometimes breaking my aunt's computer to actually writing
        my own scripts and watching my code come to life. Innately curious and a
        self-motivated learner, I was driven to learn the “ins and outs” of
        every component in a computer.

        What started out as a simple hobby soon became an obvious career path,
        which is why I decided to pursue my passion at City College of New York
        for a degree in Computer Engineering. At City College, I came to the
        realization that i enjoyed creating applications and tools with flawless
        interactions. As my knowledge about coding deepened, I learned of the
        importance of consistency, scalability and modularity.

        After graduating from city college in 2015, I was hired as a Software Developer at
        BNY Mellon | Pershing. I am committed to exceeding the expectations and goals in a
        project. Furthermore, having an experienced perspective on front end
        development, my team and coworkers rely on me to bring innovative
        solutions with the newest tech stacks.
